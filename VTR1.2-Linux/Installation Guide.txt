Installation complete, now, you need put the target proteins in the folder Data,
that is in VTR extraction folder, in this folder, there's 4 proteins of globin type
for tests, you can add more proteins in the folder by copy .pdb files to the folder.

For VTR first run, just go to the folder "Source" by terminal and tip "python3 VTR.py",
Or run the source code VTR_Geometric directly, going to the Source folder,and writing the following structure:

>> python3 VTR_Geometric.py <structure1 path> <structure2 path> <cutoff(float or int value) <structure1's chain1> <structure1's chain2> <structure2's chain1> <structure2's chain2>>
or 
>> python3 VTR_Geometric.py <structure1 path> <structure2 path> <cutoff(float or int value) <structure1's chain1> <structure1's chain2> <structure2's chain1> <structure2's chain2> d>
for detailed informations

You can see the plot running the files in folder "Plots" on Pymol last version


Now VTR generates a simple html script for plot the matches in 3Dmol
The folder Source3d contains the VTR file that generate the scripts in the Plot3d folder
