For use VTR, you need do some external settings in your machine.

Download python:
https://www.python.org/

Add python in enviroment variables(windows only):
Go to enviroment variabels settings and add in path fields, the path of the folder
that is the python installation

Download Pymol:
https://pymol.org/

Add Pymol in enviroment variables(windows only):
Go to enviroment variabels settings and add in path fields, the path of the folder
Scripts that is in the Pymol installation folder

Download MinGW:
https://osdn.net/projects/mingw/downloads/68260/mingw-get-setup.exe/

Add gcc.exe path in enviroment variables(windows only):
Go to enviroment variabels settings and add in path fields, the path of the folder
bin that is in the MinGW installation folder

Installation complete, now, you need put the target proteins in the folder Data,
that is in VTR extraction folder, in this folder, there's 4 proteins of globin type
for tests, you can add more proteins in the folder by copy .pdb files to the folder.

For VTR first run, just double click the .py file "VTR" in Source folder, after,
you can use the software by this way, or run the source code VTR_Geometric.py, going to the Source folder,
and writing the following structure:

>> python VTR_Geometric.py <structure1 path> <structure2 path> <cutoff(float or int value) <structure1's chain1> <structure1's chain2> <structure2's chain1> <structure2's chain2>>
or 
>> python VTR_Geometric.py <structure1 path> <structure2 path> <cutoff(float or int value) <structure1's chain1> <structure1's chain2> <structure2's chain1> <structure2's chain2> d>
for detailed informations

Now VTR generates a simple HTML script for plot the matches in 3Dmol
The folder Source3d contains the VTR file that generate the scripts in the Plot3d folder
