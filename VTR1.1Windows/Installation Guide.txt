and writing the following structure:

>> python VTR_Geometric.py <structure1 path> <structure2 path> <cutoff(float or int value)>
or 
>> python VTR_Geometric.py <structure1 path> <structure2 path> <cutoff(float or int value) d>
for detailed informations

New Version Log(10/12/2019):
Now VTR generates a simple php script for plot the matches in 3Dmol
The folder Source3d contains the VTR file that generate the scripts in the Plot3d folder
Just double click in VTR.py or write:

>> python VTR_Geometric.py <structure1 path> <structure2 path> <cutoff(float or int value)>
